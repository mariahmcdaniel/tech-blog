## Usage

This app is intended for sharing any thoughts related to tech. Users can create an account, add posts, add comments and read through other user's posts and comments. If a post is created and the user would like to make edits to it, this feature is available. Posts that a user no longer wants to share can be easily deleted by navigating to the post in their dashboard, clicking edit post, and then clicking the delete post button. Users may also delete their account by simply clicking the "delete account" button in their personal dashboard.
